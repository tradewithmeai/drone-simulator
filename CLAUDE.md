desired_velocity = direction_normalized * min(max_speed, proportional_gain * distance)

# Apply acceleration constraints
if acceleration_magnitude > max_acceleration:
    velocity += clamped_acceleration * delta_time
    
# Snap to target when close enough
if distance < convergence_threshold:
    position = target_position
    velocity = 0
    settled = True
```

### Recent Major Debugging Session (Aug 2025)

#### 🚨 **Critical Issues Discovered**
**Primary Problem**: GUI crashes and freezing during spawn operations
- Symptoms: "Not responding" when pressing Shift+1-5 spawn commands
- User reports: GUI loaded but crashed when drone spawning started
- Secondary issue: "Successfully spawned" messages but GUI showed 0 drones

#### 🔍 **Debugging Process & Attempts**

**Phase 1: Initial Stabilization (❌ Partial Success)**
- Attempted: Safe mode configs, hardened overlay code, optimized rendering
- Result: Improved stability but core spawn issue persisted

**Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis (✅ Breakthrough)**
- **Discovered**: Two competing command queue systems causing deadlocks
  - GUI command queue paused simulation during spawn operations
  - Simulation thread queue never processed while paused
  - Result: "Success" messages but zero actual drone creation

**Phase 3: Threading Architecture Fix (✅ Major Progress)**
- **Solution**: Eliminated GUI command queue entirely
- **Changes**: Direct keyboard input to simulation thread only
- **Result**: Unified command processing path, no more GUI freezing

**Phase 4: State Synchronization Issue (❌ Subtle Problem)**
- **Remaining Issue**: Spawn operations worked but GUI still showed 0 drones
- **Root Cause**: State callbacks only happened in simulation loop when not paused
- **Missing**: Immediate feedback after spawn operations completed

**Phase 5: GPT's Brilliant Diagnosis (✅ Complete Resolution)**
- **Key Insight**: Spawn system WAS working - GUI just wasn't getting state updates
- **Solution**: 
  1. Immediate state push after spawn operations
  2. State callbacks enabled while paused (separate from physics)
  3. Drone count confirmation logging

#### 🛠️ **Technical Fixes Applied**

**Threading Architecture Overhaul:**
```python
# Before (Problematic): 
User Input → GUI Queue → Pause Sim → Direct Spawn → Simulation Queue (never processed)

# After (Working):
User Input → Direct Simulation Queue → Thread Processing → Immediate State Push → GUI Update
```

**State Synchronization Fix:**
```python
# Added immediate callbacks after spawn operations
if self.state_update_callback:
    states = self.swarm.get_states()
    sim_info = self.get_simulation_info()
    self.state_update_callback(states, sim_info)

# Separated physics from GUI updates
with self.lock:
    if not self.paused:
        self.swarm.update(actual_dt)  # Physics only when not paused
    
    # Always push states (paused or not) for GUI
    if self.state_update_callback:
        # ... send updates
```

**Smart Defaults & Exit Controls:**
- Manual spawns now use 5 drones default in --no-spawn mode
- Added Q/ESC clean exit with graceful shutdown logging
- Enhanced error handling and validation

#### ✅ **Final Test Results**
```bash
[GUI-THREAD] Respawn command queued: 5 drones in 'line' formation
[SIM-THREAD] Processing respawn: 5 drones in 'line' formation...
[SIM-THREAD] Respawn completed: 5 drones created
Result: 5 drones in simulation  ← Fixed! (Was 0 before)
```

#### 🎓 **Lessons Learned**
1. **Threading Complexity**: Multiple command queues created subtle race conditions
2. **State vs Logic Separation**: GUI state updates and physics can be decoupled  
3. **Debug Logging Critical**: Detailed logging essential for threading issues
4. **Collaborative Debugging**: GPT's fresh perspective identified the real issue
5. **Test Isolation**: Isolated tests proved system worked, pointed to synchronization
